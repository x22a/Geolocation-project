# Geolocation Project

Using data from https://www.crunchbase.com I did a research based on three conditions to locate the headquarters of a new company.

The conditions were:
- Close to other companies focused on design. Not being older than 10 years. As the database is dated on 2013, the search query took all companies founded after that year.
- Being close to Starbucks, data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/store-locations
- Being near to an airport, the data was taken from: https://www.partow.net/miscellaneous/airportdatabase/

The most optimal locations are displayed in an interactive map where you can choose the desired location.
